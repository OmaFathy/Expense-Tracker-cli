# Expense Tracker CLI Application

A simple command-line application to manage your expenses. This application allows users to add, delete, and view their expenses, as well as provide summaries of total expenses.

## Features

- **Add an Expense**: Users can add an expense with a description and amount.
- **Update an Expense**: Users can update an existing expense.
- **Delete an Expense**: Users can delete an expense by ID.
- **View All Expenses**: Users can view a list of all expenses.
- **View Summary of Expenses**: Users can view the total expenses.
- **View Monthly Summary**: Users can view a summary of expenses for a specific month in the current year.

## Roadmap

For a detailed roadmap of the Expense Tracker project, including future features and improvements, visit the following link: [Expense Tracker Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/projects/expense-tracker).

## Requirements

- A programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, Node.js)
- A module for parsing command line arguments (e.g., `argparse` for Python, `commander` for Node.js)
- A simple text file (e.g., JSON, CSV) to store expenses data
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases (e.g., negative amounts, non-existent expense IDs)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmaFathy/Expense-Tracker-cli.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Expense-Tracker-cli
   ```

3. Install any required dependencies based on the programming language used (if applicable).

## Usage

The application can be run from the command line. Here are the available commands and their usage:

### Add an Expense

```bash
$ expense-tracker add --description "Lunch" --amount 20
```
- **Output**: Expense added successfully (ID: 1)

### List All Expenses

```bash
$ expense-tracker list
```
- **Output**:
  ```
  ID  Date       Description  Amount
  1   2024-08-06  Lunch        $20
  2   2024-08-06  Dinner       $10
  ```

The application includes error handling for:
- Negative expense amounts
- Non-existent expense IDs
- Invalid command-line arguments
