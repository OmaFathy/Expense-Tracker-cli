# Expense Tracker CLI Application

A simple command-line application to manage your expenses. This application allows users to add, delete, and view their expenses, as well as provide summaries of total expenses.

## Features

- **Add an Expense**: Users can add an expense with a description and amount.
- **Update an Expense**: Users can update an existing expense.
- **Delete an Expense**: Users can delete an expense by ID.
- **View All Expenses**: Users can view a list of all expenses.
- **View Summary of Expenses**: Users can view the total expenses.
- **View Monthly Summary**: Users can view a summary of expenses for a specific month in the current year.

## Requirements

- A programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, Node.js)
- A module for parsing command line arguments (e.g., `argparse` for Python, `commander` for Node.js)
- A simple text file (e.g., JSON, CSV) to store expenses data
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases (e.g., negative amounts, non-existent expense IDs)
